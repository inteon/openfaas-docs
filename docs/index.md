![OpenFaaS Logo](https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2017/08/faas_side.png)

OpenFaaS&reg; makes it easy for developers to deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes without repetitive, boiler-plate coding. Package your code or an existing binary in a Docker image to get a highly scalable endpoint with auto-scaling and metrics.

* Write functions in any language and package them in Docker/OCI-format containers
* Easy to use - built-in UI, powerful CLI and one-click installation
* Scale as you go - handle spikes in traffic, and scale down when idle
* Ecosystem - community marketplace for functions and language templates

Pick your version:

* [OpenFaaS Standard/For Enterprises](/openfaas-pro/introduction/) for commercial use and production
* faasd or Community Edition - explore functions, or build a Proof of Concept (PoC) without any costs
